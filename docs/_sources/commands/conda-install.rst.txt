          Installs a list of packages into a specified conda environment.
   
                 This command accepts a  list  of  package  specifications  (e.g,
                 bitarray=0.8)  and  installs  a  set of packages consistent with
                 those specifications and compatible with the underlying environ‐
                 ment.  If  full  compatibility  cannot  be  assured, an error is
                 reported and the environment is not changed.
   
                 Conda attempts to install the newest versions of  the  requested
                 packages.  To  accomplish this, it may update some packages that
                 are already installed, or install additional packages.  To  pre‐
                 vent  existing  packages from updating, use the --no-update-deps
                 option. This may force conda to install older  versions  of  the
                 requested  packages,  and  it does not prevent additional depen‐
                 dency packages from being installed.
   
                 If you wish to skip  dependency  checking  altogether,  use  the
                 '--force'  option. This may result in an environment with incom‐
                 patible packages, so this option must be used  with  great  cau‐
                 tion.
   
                 conda  can  also be called with a list of explicit conda package
                 filenames (e.g.  ./lxml-3.2.0-py27_0.tar.bz2).  Using  conda  in
                 this  mode  implies  the  --force option, and should likewise be
                 used with great caution. Explicit filenames and package specifi‐
                 cations cannot be mixed in a single command.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          package_spec
                 Packages to install or update in the conda environment.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          --revision REVISION
                 Revert to the specified REVISION.
   
          -y, --yes
                 Do not ask for confirmation.
   
          --dry-run
                 Only display what would have been done.
   
          -f, --force
                 Force install (even when package already installed).
   
          --file FILE
                 Read  package versions from the given file. Repeated file speci‐
                 fications can be passed (e.g. --file=file1 --file=file2).
   
          --no-deps
                 Do not install, update, remove,  or  change  dependencies.  This
                 WILL  lead to broken environments and inconsistent behavior. Use
                 at your own risk.
   
          --only-deps
                 Only install dependencies.
   
          -m, --mkdir
                 Create the environment directory if necessary.
   
          -C, --use-index-cache
                 Use cache of channel index files, even if it has expired.
   
          --use-local
                 Use locally built packages.
   
          --offline
                 Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.
   
          --no-pin
                 Ignore pinned file.
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are  URLs
                 searched  in  the  order  they  are given (including file:// for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are  searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can use
                 'defaults' to get the default packages for conda,  and  'system'
                 to  get  the  system  packages,  which  also takes .condarc into
                 account. You can also  use  any  name  and  the  .condarc  chan‐
                 nel_alias  value will be prepended. The default channel_alias is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment.
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full path to environment prefix.
   
          -q, --quiet
                 Do not display progress bar.
   
          --copy Install all packages using copies instead of hard- or soft-link‐
                 ing.
   
          -k, --insecure
                 Allow conda to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.
                 Equivalent to setting 'ssl_verify' to 'false'.
   
          --update-dependencies, --update-deps
                 Update dependencies. Overrides the value given by `conda  config
                 --show update_deps`.
   
          --no-update-dependencies, --no-update-deps
                 Don't  update  dependencies. Overrides the value given by `conda
                 config --show update_deps`.
   
          --channel-priority, --channel-pri, --chan-pri
                 Channel priority takes precedence over  package  version.  Over‐
                 rides the value given by `conda config --show channel_priority`.
   
          --no-channel-priority, --no-channel-pri, --no-chan-pri
                 Package  version  takes  precedence over channel priority. Over‐
                 rides the value given by `conda config --show channel_priority`.
   
          --clobber
                 Allow clobbering of overlapping file paths within packages,  and
                 suppress related warnings.
   
          --show-channel-urls
                 Show  channel  urls.  Overrides the value given by `conda config
                 --show show_channel_urls`.
   
          --no-show-channel-urls
                 Don't show channel urls. Overrides the  value  given  by  `conda
                 config --show show_channel_urls`.
   
          --download-only
                 Solve  an  environment  and ensure package caches are populated,
                 but exit prior to unlinking and linking packages into  the  pre‐
                 fix.
   
          --json Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmati‐
                 cally.
   
          --debug
                 Show debug output.
   
          --verbose, -v
                 Use once for info, twice for debug, three times for trace.
