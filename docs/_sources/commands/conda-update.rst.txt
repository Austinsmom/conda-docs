          [--no-deps]
   
          [--only-deps] [-m] [-C] [--use-local] [--offline]
                 [--no-pin] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels] [-n ENVIRONMENT  |
                 -p    PATH]    [-q]    [--copy]   [-k]   [--update-dependencies]
                 [--no-update-dependencies]   [--channel-priority]    [--no-chan‐
                 nel-priority] [--clobber] [--show-channel-urls] [--no-show-chan‐

          Updates conda packages to the latest compatible version.
   
                 This command accepts a list of package names and updates them to
                 the latest versions that are compatible with all other  packages
                 in the environment.
   
                 Conda  attempts  to install the newest versions of the requested
                 packages. To accomplish this, it may update some  packages  that
                 are  already  installed, or install additional packages. To pre‐
                 vent existing packages from updating, use  the  --no-update-deps
                 option.  This  may  force conda to install older versions of the
                 requested packages, and it does not  prevent  additional  depen‐
                 dency packages from being installed.
   
                 If  you  wish  to  skip  dependency checking altogether, use the
                 '--force' option. This may result in an environment with  incom‐
                 patible  packages,  so  this option must be used with great cau‐
                 tion.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          package_spec
                 Packages to install or update in the conda environment.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -y, --yes
                 Do not ask for confirmation.
   
          --dry-run
                 Only display what would have been done.
   
          -f, --force
                 Force install (even when package already installed).
   
          --file FILE
                 Read package versions from the given file. Repeated file  speci‐
                 fications can be passed (e.g. --file=file1 --file=file2).
   
          --no-deps
                 Do  not  install,  update,  remove, or change dependencies. This
                 WILL lead to broken environments and inconsistent behavior.  Use
                 at your own risk.
   
          --only-deps
                 Only install dependencies.
   
          -m, --mkdir
                 Create the environment directory if necessary.
   
          -C, --use-index-cache
                 Use cache of channel index files, even if it has expired.
   
          --use-local
                 Use locally built packages.
   
          --offline
                 Offline mode, don't connect to the Internet.
   
          --no-pin
                 Ignore pinned file.
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -n ENVIRONMENT, --name ENVIRONMENT
                 Name of environment.
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 Full path to environment prefix.
   
          -q, --quiet
                 Do not display progress bar.
   
          --copy Install all packages using copies instead of hard- or soft-link‐
                 ing.
   
          -k, --insecure
                 Allow conda to perform "insecure" SSL connections and transfers.
                 Equivalent to setting 'ssl_verify' to 'false'.
   
          --update-dependencies, --update-deps
                 Update  dependencies. Overrides the value given by `conda config
                 --show update_deps`.
   
          --no-update-dependencies, --no-update-deps
                 Don't update dependencies. Overrides the value given  by  `conda
                 config --show update_deps`.
   
          --channel-priority, --channel-pri, --chan-pri
                 Channel  priority  takes  precedence over package version. Over‐
                 rides the value given by `conda config --show channel_priority`.
   
          --no-channel-priority, --no-channel-pri, --no-chan-pri
                 Package version takes precedence over  channel  priority.  Over‐
                 rides the value given by `conda config --show channel_priority`.
   
          --clobber
                 Allow  clobbering of overlapping file paths within packages, and
                 suppress related warnings.
   
          --show-channel-urls
                 Show channel urls. Overrides the value given  by  `conda  config
                 --show show_channel_urls`.
   
          --no-show-channel-urls
                 Don't  show  channel  urls.  Overrides the value given by `conda
                 config --show show_channel_urls`.
   
          --download-only
                 Solve an environment and ensure package  caches  are  populated,
                 but  exit  prior to unlinking and linking packages into the pre‐
                 fix.
   
          --json Report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmati‐
                 cally.
   
          --debug
                 Show debug output.
   
          --verbose, -v
                 Use once for info, twice for debug, three times for trace.
   
          --all  Update all installed packages in the environment.
