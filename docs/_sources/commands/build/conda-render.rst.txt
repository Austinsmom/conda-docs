                 bose] RECIPE_PATH
   
          Tool for building conda packages. A conda package is a  binary  tarball
          containing system-level libraries, Python modules, executable programs,
          or other components. conda keeps track of dependencies between packages
          and platform specifics, making it simple to create working environments
          from
   
                 different sets of packages.
   
   OPTIONS
      positional arguments:
          RECIPE_PATH
                 Path to recipe directory.
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 Show this help message and exit.
   
          -V, --version
                 Show the conda-build version number and exit.
   
          -n, --no-source
                 When templating can't be completed, do not obtain the source  to
                 try fill in related template variables.
   
          --output
                 Output the conda package filename which would have been created
   
          --python PYTHON
                 Set the Python version used by conda build.
   
          --perl PERL
                 Set the Perl version used by conda build.
   
          --numpy NUMPY
                 Set the NumPy version used by conda build.
   
          --R R_BASE
                 Set the R version used by conda build.
   
          --lua LUA
                 Set the Lua version used by conda build.
   
          --bootstrap BOOTSTRAP
                 Provide  initial  configuration in addition to recipe.  Can be a
                 path to or name of an environment, which will be emulated in the
                 package.
   
          --append-file APPEND_SECTIONS_FILE
                 Append  data in meta.yaml with fields from this file.  Jinja2 is
                 not done on appended fields
   
          --clobber-file CLOBBER_SECTIONS_FILE
                 Clobber data in meta.yaml with fields from this file.  Jinja2 is
                 not done on clobbered fields.
   
          -m VARIANT_CONFIG_FILES, --variant-config-files VARIANT_CONFIG_FILES
                 Additional  variant  config  files  to add. These yaml files can
                 contain keys such as `c_compiler` and `target_platform` to  form
                 a build matrix.
   
          -e   EXCLUSIVE_CONFIG_FILES,   --exclusive-config-files  EXCLUSIVE_CON‐
          FIG_FILES, --exclusive-config-file EXCLUSIVE_CONFIG_FILES
                 Exclusive variant config files to add. Providing files here dis‐
                 ables  searching  in  your  home directory and in cwd. The files
                 specified here come at the start of the order, as opposed to the
                 end  with --variant-configfiles. Any config files in recipes and
                 any config  files  specified  with  --variant-config-files  will
                 override values from these files.
   
          --old-build-string
                 Disable hash additions to filenames to distinguish package vari‐
                 ants from one another. NOTE: any filename collisions  are  yours
                 to  handle.  Any  variants with overlapping names within a build
                 will clobber each other.
   
          --variants VARIANTS
                 Variants to extend the  build  matrix.  Must  be  a  valid  YAML
                 instance, such as "{python: [3.6, 3.7]}"
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -f FILE, --file FILE
                 write  YAML to file, given as argument here. Overwrites existing
                 files.
   
          --verbose
                 Enable verbose output from download tools and progress updates
   
      conda commands available from other packages:
                 build convert debug develop env index inspect metapackage render
                 skeleton
